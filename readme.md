## PicStory App
For this group project, our team built a travel photo-sharing app with full CRUD functionality. The front end is constructed in Angular, and Firebase is being used to host the database as well as host the deployed site. This app lets users host their travel photo albums, update/delete/add to existing albums, create/update/delete new albums, plan their next trip with a "trip planner" page, and become a better travel photographer with a "photography tips" page.

### Followup Features:
There are a couple features that we would still like to add onto the app. One feature would be adding functionality to the google map so it pulls in coordinate data from the album photos and displays that data on the map. It would be ideal to host a version of google maps in the trip planner page as well. We would also pull in content from the Weather Underground API on the trip planner page so that you can type in a possible destination and see what the weather is like.
