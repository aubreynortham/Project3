				How to Get Started
			</h2>
			<ul>
        <li><p>When you arrive at your destination, be open and try to take note of the first impressions—write them down if you have to. (A notebook is an essential accessory for a travel photographer.)</p></li>
        <li><p>Understanding the customs and traditions of a place is vital. Be sure you act in a way that is not rude or offensive while you are there, and understand the culture you're trying to capture.</p></li>
        <li><p>Many places, particularly hot ones, are active very early in the morning and late in the afternoon but rather in a lull around midday. Get up early, stay out late.</p></li>
        <li><p>Get lost. Wander down alleys. Sit in cafés and watch life pass by. Don't eat where the tourists do, but where you see locals. Just set off down a street and see where it leads.</p></li>
        <li><p>Think of it as hunting—whenever you leave the confines of your camp, you should be ready and able to capture whatever pops up.</p></li>
        <li><p>Never be satisfied with your first view of a place or the first frame you snap. It's always possible—and usually likely—that you can come up with something better. Get closer, then get closer still. Try different angles, different lenses.</p></li>

				People and Portraits
			</h2>
			<ul>
        <li><p>Create a catch-light in the subject's eyes with a small reflector, such as a dulled mirror or the silver side of a CD, to add a bit of glimmer.</p></li>
        <li><p>When using an electronic flash indoors, move your subject away from walls to prevent harsh shadows.</p></li>
        <li><p>When photographing people interacting with each other or with pets, observe their behavior and think about what they might do to express the essence of the relationship.</p></li>
        <li><p>Portraits of people from other cultures have to do double duty—they have to be honest about the exotic nature of the people while conveying our common humanity.</p></li>
        <li><p>If you are traveling in a foreign land, learn at least a few phrases of the local language. Your reception and ability to make photographs—and your whole experience—will be enhanced.</p></li>
        <li><p>Be careful if you are using a wide-angle lens to photograph a group. The people at the edges may get distorted.</p></li>
        <li><p>If kids want to look through the camera, let them. They will be more relaxed and cooperative. Just watch out for dirty fingers on the lens.</p></li>
			</ul>

				Landscapes
			</h2>
			<ul>
        <li><p>Get out before sunrise and stay out after sunset—the times when the light is best. Use the harsher light of midday to scout.</p></li>
        <li><p>Be careful in the placement of foreground elements. You don't want them to detract from what your photograph is really about.</p></li>
        <li><p>If you want circular star trails, point the camera at the North Star.</p></li>
        <li><p>When making long exposures, use a remote release to avoid camera movement. If you don't have a remote release, use the camera's self-timer. And be mindful of any breeze that might be moving your subject.</p></li>
        <li><p>If you are with friends, don't be shy about using them in images to get a sense of scale. But remember that the photos are of the place, not the people.</p></li>
        <li><p>Lens flare can be a problem with wide lenses. Use your hand or a piece of cardboard to screen the lens from the sun—but keep the screen out of the frame.</p></li>
        <li><p>Since we usually look for details, it can be harder to see blocks of color or shape. Squint a bit: Details will blur and you will see things as masses.</p></li>
      </ul>
